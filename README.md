# freeCodeCamp Landing Page Project

----

## Synopsis

This is a project based off of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Landing Page project.

## Code Example

You can check it out [here](https://ryanjmack.github.io/mock-landing-page/)!

## Motivation

This is a continuation of the projects for the Responsive Web Design Curriculum at freeCodeCamp. This was made responsive using just CSS with *no* libraries or frameworks.

This project really helped me get even more comfortable with HTML/CSS, gulp and also SCSS. Even more I learned what I can do even better next time in regards to project design and architecture.

For my next project (freeCodeCamp's Technical Documentation Page) I am going to to focus on two things: using relative units such as em and rem more (especially for breakpoints/media queries), and also learning how to better organize my CSS with a methodology such as BEM.

I also want gain a deeper understanding of flexbox so I am currently taking the course (and am more than 80% done with) [*What the Flexbox?!*](https://flexbox.io/).

Overall each project pushes the boundaries of what I know and what I still don't know. This excites me because with each project I feel I am steadily getting more proficient with my work.
